**If you do not yet have access to the Marketo Sandbox Instance please send an email to Mihaela**

### Requirements:

- Fork the repo
- Create your own branch containing your first and last name
- The project requires dependencies, those are missing. Install and run Gulp using the 'gulp' command.
- Add SASS style & Marketo form to recreate the design provided in the 'img' folder, all other assets can be found in this folder as well
- H1 & H2 titles editable in Marketo
- Make banner "button" editable, both text and href
- Embed Marketo form to the landing page which can be found here: https://app-lon02.marketo.com/#FO1520A1ZN13LA1
- Make a small javascript that prefills your first name, last name and email address in the Marketo form in the script file. Not inline in the HTML.

**Mobile responsiveness is not required but is a plus. You can find a media-queries mixin in the 'mixins' folder.**
