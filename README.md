# Test Project

### Before you start:

All documentation you will need regarding the Marketo specific requirements can be found in following links
1. https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Create+a+Guided+Landing+Page+Template
2. https://developers.marketo.com/javascript-api/forms/api-reference/
3. https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/assets/forms/examples/
4. https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/


**If you do not yet have access to the Marketo Sandbox Instance please let your LeadFabric contact know**

### Requirements:

- Fork the repo
- Create your own branch containing your first and last name
- The project requires dependencies, those are missing. Install Gulp, install the dependencies and compile the project using the 'gulp' command.
- Add SASS style & Marketo form to recreate the design provided in the 'img' folder, all other assets can be found in this folder as well: https://github.com/dirixtom/lf-test/blob/master/app/img/brief.png
- H1 & H2 titles editable in Marketo
- Make banner "button" editable, both text and href
- Embed Marketo form to the landing page which can be found here: https://app-lon02.marketo.com/#FO1520A1ZN13LA1
- Make a small javascript that prefills your first name, last name and email address in the Marketo form in the script file. Not inline in the HTML.
- Remove the 'dist' folder from the .gitignore file, stage & commit your changes and let your contact within LeadFabric know you're done, including a link to your fork or create a pull request.

**Bonus:**
- Add a boolean that shows/hide the H2 title and make it hidden by default
- Make the design responsive (desktop-first strategy). You can find a media-queries mixin in the 'mixins' folder.


**Approximate values are fine. Don't lose time on nitpicking colors, font sizes, paddings, border radii, ... in reality these are copy-pasted from brand guideline files or existing assets**

Good luck!
